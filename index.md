    title: "Independent Study Based in Electronic Speed Controller Design and Operation"
    excerpt: "I completed an independent study in which I assembled a PCB breakout board for a dsPIC microcontroller and explored methods and tools for precise motor control. This included using encoders to determine motor speed and direction, implementing pulse-width modulation, and designing and utilizing H-bridge circuits. I developed motor drivers in MPLAB for both brushed and brushless motor control using the H-bridge circuitry, and implemented a PID controller to achieve precise servo control of a brushed motor. Additionally, I used MATLAB and Simulink to analyze motor performance data and debug the motor control drivers. "
